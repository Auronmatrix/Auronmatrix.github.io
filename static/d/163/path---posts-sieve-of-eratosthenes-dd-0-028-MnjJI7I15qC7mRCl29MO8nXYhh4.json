Selecting the first prime and then flagging non primes (composites) as the multiples of that prime. After flagging all composites for the selected prime, it moves on to the next number, which would be a prime and does the same, until reaching the limit. </p>\n<p>A super simple implementation of this would be something along these lines</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">const basic = (limit) =&gt; {\n  const NumSet = new Set()\n  const PrimeSet = new Set()\n\n  for (let p = 2; p &lt;= limit; p++) {\n    if (!NumSet.has(p)) {\n      PrimeSet.add(p)\n      \n      for (let k = p; k &lt;= limit; k++) {\n        NumSet.add(k * p)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return PrimeSet\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note that here I’m using two sets, one containing all the primes and another containing all the composites. It is an extremely naive implementation and would run out of memory for <code class=\"language-text\">limits &gt; 15000</code> with the default nodejs memory limits. </p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/prime-numbers/","/tags/computer-science/","/tags/mathematics/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Digging into the Sieve of Eratosthenes","tags":["Prime Numbers","Computer Science","Mathematics"],"date":"2018-10-18T16:51:00.000Z","description":"Quick look at a simple, ancient method for finding primes"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/sieve-of-eratosthenes/"}}
