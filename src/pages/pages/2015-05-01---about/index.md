I'm a full-stack developer focused on building tools and services (mostly blockchain related atm) using Nodejs, React and Docker for getting stuff done.

Dabbler in different things including cryptography, security, calisthenics, clean coding, leadership and [Japanese aesthetics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miomuSGoPzI). 

Currently situated in the Beer Capital of Germany and yes, digging the lederhosen.
